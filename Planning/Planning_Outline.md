# Planning for Project 2


# MVP: STEAMers’ Lesson Library 

## Intro: build a simple way for NCRC preschool teachers to keep-track-of, share and comment on STEAM [Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics] related projects/lessons.  

## Models:

+ 1. Lessons: CRUD
+ Title:
+ Author: [Instructor(s)’ Name]
+ Description
+ Materials
+ Estimated Time-to-Complete
+ Pre-requisites 
+ Age Level
+ Instructions
+ Attachments [photos/videos]

+ 2. Feedback: CRUD
+ Title of the Lesson they’re commenting on
+ Author of the comment
+ feedback/comment

+ 3. Users [aka Instructors] //Note: will add User model if there’s time to attempt Authentication .
+ Name
+ Email 
+ SME [subject matter expertise]


## Research:
+ Will most likely emulate parts of the Recipe & Tweeter app.
+ Will also look at other sites online for inspiration/ideas:
+ https://www.educationworld.com/a_lesson/archives/science.shtml
+ https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/classic-spaghetti-and-meatballs

## Tech:
+ MEHN Stack
+ Dependencies: express, handlebars, body-parser, method-override, mongoose [potentially: passport]

## Wireframe [rough draft]
+ https://photos.app.goo.gl/vruL3HwLckR2kBHL9

## Reach Goals: [if time permits]
+ Leverage Bootstrap or Materialize
+ Star Ratings
+ Categories
+ Sorting
+ Search
+ Authentication
+ Feather
